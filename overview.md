overview of the proposed Energy Distribution Management System. Based on the provided information, the system will have the following key characteristics and objectives:

1. **Digitalization:** The system is designed to digitize and automate various processes related to energy distribution management. This involves the processing of data through computers, enabling efficient and accurate handling of information.
2. **Data Processing:** The system will receive data as input, and computer systems will automatically process this data. It suggests that the system may involve data analysis, calculations, and decision-making based on the data.
3. **Database Integration:** Unlike the old system, the proposed system will have a database where data is stored for reference and retrieval. This database is expected to play a central role in data management and analysis.
4. **Decision Support:** The system aims to support the planning, control, and operational functions of an organization by providing timely and uniform information. This information is expected to assist in decision-making processes within the energy distribution domain.
5. **Data Representation:** The system will present information in various formats, such as reports, graphs, images, and sounds. This diverse range of representations can aid users in understanding and interpreting the data.
6. **Consumer Data Analysis:** The system will gather consumer data to evaluate the performance of energy products and services. It can be used to identify popular products and gauge consumer demand, enabling more effective production planning.

Given these characteristics and objectives, you can start outlining the functional requirements and features of the Energy Distribution Management System. Here are some aspects to consider:

- **User Roles:** Identify the types of users who will interact with the system (e.g., administrators, energy suppliers, consumers).
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data security and access control.
- **Data Management:** Design the database schema to store relevant data, including energy consumption, product sales, and consumer information.
- **Reporting and Visualization:** Implement tools to generate reports, charts, and other visual representations of data.
- **Automation:** Develop automated processes for data processing, decision support, and product tracking.
- **Integration:** Consider integrating external systems or APIs for data collection and analysis.
- **Security:** Implement security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
- **User Interface:** Design a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the system and access information.
- **Testing and Deployment:** Plan the testing phase and deployment strategy for the system.
- **Training:** Provide training for users and administrators to effectively utilize the system.
- **Support and Maintenance:** Establish procedures for ongoing support, maintenance, and updates.
